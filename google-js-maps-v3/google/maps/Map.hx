Based on original Google JS API documentation

  This class extends MVCObject.

This class produces the following events:
Event Name : Arguments - Description
======================================
idle : Void - This event is fired when the map becomes idle after panning or
zooming.
drag : Void - This event is repeatedly fired while the user drags the map.
zoom_changed : Void - This event is fired when the map zoom property changes.
tilesloaded : Void - This event is fired when the visible tiles have finished loading.
center_changed : Void - This event is fired when the map center property changes.
resize : Void - Developers should trigger this event on the map when the div changes
size: google.maps.event.trigger(map, 'resize')
.
mousemove : MouseEvent - This event is fired whenever the user's mouse moves over the map
container.
rightclick : MouseEvent - This event is fired when the DOM contextmenu event is fired on the
map container.
bounds_changed : Void - This event is fired when the viewport bounds have changed.
mouseout : MouseEvent - This event is fired when the user's mouse exits the map container.
dblclick : MouseEvent - This event is fired when the user double-clicks on the map.
Note that the click event will also fire, right before this one.
mouseover : MouseEvent - This event is fired when the user's mouse enters the map container.
dragstart : Void - This event is fired when the user starts dragging the map.
dragend : Void - This event is fired when the user stops dragging the map.
projection_changed : Void - This event is fired when the projection has changed.
click : MouseEvent - This event is fired when the user clicks on the map
(but not when they click on a marker or infowindow).
maptypeid_changed : Void - This event is fired when the mapTypeId property changes.

type and navigation controls, if they are present on the map.  If the bounds
